### 🖼 Description

**Modern-Office-Night-Icons** is a modern, unified icon set designed to complement the [Modern-Office-Night GTK theme](https://www.pling.com/p/2346850/).
The design draws inspiration from modern commercial operating systems — without using any commercial assets — resulting in a clean, neutral, and professional aesthetic that aligns with the GTK theme.
It aims to deliver a clean and visually consistent desktop experience for Linux Mint Cinnamon users, while remaining fully compatible with other GTK-based desktop environments.

The set includes custom-designed folder icons, numerous updated application icons, and selected category icons.

It is partially based on open-source icon themes licensed under the GPL, including:

* **Breeze** – many icons were used as-is or modified
* **Numix-Circle** – occasionally used for some application icons
* **Papirus** – used in very small parts (e.g., one or two icons)
* **Hicolor** – one or two icons included from this fallback theme

**Modern-Office-Night** was created as a dark counterpart to the **[Modern Office Day](https://www.pling.com/p/2340062/)** theme (which is also a Breeze derivative). Compared to the Breeze icon theme, this set:

* Redesigns many outdated icons to match a modern aesthetic
* Introduces many icons created from scratch
* Carefully curates and unifies the overall look to better fit the Cinnamon environment
